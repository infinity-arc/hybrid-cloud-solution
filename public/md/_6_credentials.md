![Credentials](https://em-proposal-assets.now.sh/public/png/credentials.png)

For this backup operation to function, two sets of **credentials** will be created, the ***first set*** will be for programmatic access. This means that the software implemented on the local server will use these credentials to open the tunnel to the cloud storage area to initiate the backup. These credentials can either be one time credentials, meaning that the cloud first provides the software on site with a set of credentials to start the process. This is best practice according to [AWS best practice](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) but also requires more complex configuration on the client side and the cloud side. The alternative is a single set of credentials that the local backup software will always use to gain access to the cloud backups. The ***second set*** of credentials will be for user access to cloud backups via the management console.
